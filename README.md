# Bonsai

A simplified game development framework written in C# and XNA. Focus on productivity. 

This is a hobby project of mine that I've been slowly cultivating in my down-time, much like a Bonsai tree. 

My goal is for it to be effective enough for use in game jams.

## Up and running

Note: The project files are for VS 2012.

For the code to compile you need to install XNA.
