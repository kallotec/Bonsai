# Bonsai

A lightweight game development framework written in C# and MonoGame. Focus on simplicity and productivity. 

This is a hobby project that I've been slowly cultivating over a long period of time, much like you would a Bonsai tree. 

My goal is for it to be useful and effective enough for use in game jams.
