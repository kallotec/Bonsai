# Bonsai

A simplified game development framework written in C# and XNA. This is a hobby project of mine that I work 
on from time to time for fun, and sometimes for use in game jams.

Yes XNA is effectively a deprecated technology, but for me it is very productive and simply a pleasure to work with.

## Up and running

WARNING: The project files are for VS 2012.

Also, XNA requires some setup these days. The best guide is the following link for VS 2012:

Unknown if VS 2015 workarounds are available. Maybe one day I'll upgrade it.
